=====================================
Proposal for RasperryPi OS Project
=====================================

Stephen Chavez and Joshua Michael Waggoner

Abstract:
==============

For our final project we plan to create a minimal operating system that will be
implemented on a Raspberry Pi, using ARMv6 assembly language. The operating
system will be capable of manipulating all GPIO pins that are on the Raspberry
Pi's board, displaying text, and executing commands. From this skeleton of an 
operating system, we plan to add more functionality as time goes on, and possibly
use it for educational purposes in the future. 

*Note: Can be connected to optional LED cube assembly through a GPIO breakout cable.

Materials:
==============

- Raspberry Pi (Model B) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi
- Blank 2GB SD Card -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital
- Various LEDs - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode (optional)
- Various wires and/or cables to connect the Pi and external units. (optional)


Project goals:
==============

We will target the following specific goals and tasks to do from this project:
   - We will learn how most operating systems boot up once you switch the power on.
   - We will know how to take input from the user, display text to the screen,
     directly with our own code, and interact with other hardware in the later stages 
     of the project, leaving it open for later improvements and added functionality.
   - We will be use and improve our understanding of ARM assembly language.
   - We will learn how to "pair program".
   - We will learn how to keep and manage a repository of a large project using git-hub.
   - We will learn leadership skills, and how to work in teams.
