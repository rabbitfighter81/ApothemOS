=====================================
Proposal for RasperryPi OS Project
=====================================


Stephen Chavez and Joshua Michael Waggoner

Abstract:
==============

For our final project we plan to create a minimal operating system that will be
implemented on a Raspberry Pi, using ARMv6 assembly language. The operating
system will be capable of manipulating the GPIO pins that are on the Raspberry
Pi's board, and they will in turn communicate to an Arduino unit that we will
use to create a multimedia light show that will involve triggered audio and led
lights. Estimated total cost is under $100. 

Materials:
==============

- Raspberry Pi (Model B) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi
- Arduino Uno -  http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno#.Uy-uQXVdWzU
- Blank 2GB SD Card -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital
- Various LEDs - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode
- Various wires and/or cables to connect the units, LEDs and speakers


Project goals:
==============

We will target the following specific goals and tasks to do from this project.
We will learn how most operating systems boot up once you switch the power on.
We will know how to take input from the user, display text to the screen
directly with our own code, interact with other hardware in the later stages of
the project. We will implement some threading management in order to understand
how multiple programs run at the same time. For the last part of this project,
we will attempt to produce MIDI music and sync with the beats using color leds
using the Arduino microcontroller.
